Object structure
----------------
- An object consists of 
    - nodes (at least one)
        - one of the nodes is the main node
    - edges (at least one)

- A node
    - has a label
    - has a name
    - has fields
    - can be optional

- An edge
    - has a type
    - has two endnodes:
        - the source node
        - the target node
    - has at least one endnode which belongs to the object
    - is internal, if its source and target node belongs to the object
    - is external, if its source or its target does not belong to the object
    - can be multiple if it is external
    - can be optional

- An object is an instance of a class

- A main node
    - has a class definition, which can be
        - a reference to the class
        - an edge to the class
        - stored directly in the node
    - has information about the object's available edges
        - the number of available edges for each type and direction
        - 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Object form
-----------
- The object form has separate sections for each nodes of the object (node forms)
- Node fields are displayed

- Internal edges are displayed


Connecting objects
------------------

- Object form (of initial object)
    - The form has separate sections for each nodes
    - Node properties are displayed
    - Internal edges are displayed
        - An internal edge is displayed on its both endnodes' sections
        - An optional edge can be deleted
        - A deleted edge is still displayed, but marked as deleted
    - External edges are displayed
        - The connected external object's name is displayed
        - All connectable objects are listed (except the selected) and one or more can be selected
            - Connectable objects are objects which have available matching edges
                - A matching edge has same type and opposite direction as the initial edge
            - One can be selected if the edge is not multiple
            - Multiple can be selected if the edge is multiple
            - When an object is selected for one edge, it still may be selected for other edges if it still has available edges
